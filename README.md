# HW5-Morgan-fingerprint
A rough neural network that converts the lipophilicity file data into morgan fingerprints, characterized by an MLP regressor and accepting three arguments. Getting all the needed data from youtube/ notes/ luck was hair-pulling, and I had originally hoped to convert many of the sections, such as the parse section, into a def so that it would be cleaner.
Homework was completed in service of the VCU CLSE-572 class.
Have a good weekend.
